It's been quite a year! I wanted to make a quick recap of what I've done this year (outside of work):

- [Service Atlas](https://github.com/service-atlas) has been the big project of the year with:
	- Creating  new organization in Github and learning all that
	- Learning Go for the backend
	- Learning neo4j
	- Learning to effectively vibe code the frontend
	- Created an MCP server to connect to the API
- Learning Go concurrency by building a [file parser](https://github.com/jlpdeveloper/go-file-parsing)
- Built Plandicoot, a private project for project resource allocation
- This blog (46/52 isn't half bad)
- Renewed all my AWS Certifications
- Gained a new Python certification from O'Reilly
- I've been using [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/) to read articles every day

As for this blog, my goal was a weekly post for a year, which I've done pretty good on. I may tone this down to bi-weekly as I'd like to start doing more technical posts. I also intended to get deeper into AI (AWS Gen AI cert, new projects, etc.) so hopefully these two can synergize.
