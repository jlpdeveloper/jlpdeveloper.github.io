I've had this list laying around and honestly I don't know that its worth putting into paragraph form, so I present it here in its raw form

Being staff + is about:

- lifting up engineers
- helping teams find their voice, giving them agency and ownership
- helping architect the right problem at the right time for the tough problems
- thinking strategically
- understanding value to the company
- being approachable and working well with junior to c-suite
- being a role model
- being a leader
- having courage
	- to say the tough things
- acknowledging limitations
- documenting and mapping
- keeping everyone in the loop
- turning groups of people into high functioning teams
- knowing when its "good enough"
	- knowing when it will stop being "good enough"


This list will probably grow as I think of more things, so I'll probably keep editing this list
