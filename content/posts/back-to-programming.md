This weeks post will be a bit of quick one, not too much going on. One thing of interest I've noted about myself is even successes in hard games (like SilkSong) aren't as rewarding anymore. I play a few hours, got to and defeated Moorwing, and I haven't even thought about it again. It was just "meh". After that I picked up my secret project (which may stop being secret soon) and honestly I found that much more rewarding, even if AI was doing some of the heavy lifting. Even a simple PR was better, maybe because its progress towards something that I know the end state? Or maybe because I control the end state. 

Either way, I think the lesson here is don't let your side projects fall of. Put some time every week into them and they will reward you just with the fact they are "done" some day.

Other than the above thoughts, here are some links I thought were interesting this week:
