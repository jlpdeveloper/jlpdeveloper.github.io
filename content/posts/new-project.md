Not posting anything of interest this week. Most of my energy is going to designing a new project I'll quickly note that I'm in that weird spot between projects. The [go parsing](https://github.com/jlpdeveloper/go-file-parsing) experiments project is done, with pretty good results given my limited knowledge of go. Hopefully this pattern can be helpful to someone in the future. 

The space between projects is weird to me, and I don't 100% like it. Not having *something* interesting queued up is boring, but at the same time designing one project when another is happening splits focus in a dangerous fashion and just leads to orphand projects. It's a fine line to walk. I have to say my new marsupial themed project has me excited (even for front end). Its going to be interesting to say the least.
